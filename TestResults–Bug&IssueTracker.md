Perfect ðŸŒ¿
Iâ€™ll now turn your scattered test results into a **GitHub Issues Template** in Markdown, grouped by module, with checklists for each bug. This way, AI agents or devs can pick, track, and close issues systematically.

Hereâ€™s the structured draft:

âš¡ **Next step:** You can drop this into a GitHub repo as `TEST_RESULTS.md` or split into multiple GitHub Issues using the checklists.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also **convert this into individual GitHub issue files (YAML/JSON for automation)** so AI agents can auto-create issues in your repo, or do you prefer to keep it as a single consolidated tracker?
