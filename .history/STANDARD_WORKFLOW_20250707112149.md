# Standard Collaborative Workflow

This document outlines the mandatory process for all development tasks.

1. **Analyze & Plan**: First, the AI agent must think through the problem, read the relevant codebase and project documentation, and write a detailed, step-by-step plan.
2. **Present Checklist**: The plan must be presented as a clear checklist of tasks (a to-do list).
3. **User Verification**: **No code will be generated until the user has reviewed and explicitly approved the plan.** This is a critical checkpoint.
4. **Iterative Development**: We will then proceed through the checklist items one by one.
5. **Explain Every Step**: Each response containing code must be accompanied by a high-level explanation of the changes made and the purpose of the new code.
6. **Simplicity & Clarity**: Every task and code change must be kept as simple and focused as possible. We will avoid making massive or complex changes in a single step.
7. **Final Review**: At the end of a feature's development, the AI will provide a summary of the changes made and confirm the completion of all checklist items.
8. **Module Summary for Documentation**: After a feature is complete, the AI will provide a concise summary of the module's functionality, purpose, and key features. This is for your records and for creating end-user documentation and training materials.
