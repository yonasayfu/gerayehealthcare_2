This document summarizes the development progress and key architectural decisions made for the Home-to-Home Care Platform from the beginning of the project up to the completion of Day n.

Modules Completed
Patients Module (Day 1-2):

Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality was implemented.

Features include server-side search, sortable columns, and pagination.

Export to CSV/PDF and a custom print view were added.

Staff Module (Day 3):

Full CRUD functionality was implemented.

A key feature is the ability to upload, store, and display staff profile photos.

Resolved a MethodNotAllowedHttpException by correctly spoofing PUT requests from forms.

Caregiver Assignments Module (Day 4):

This "bridge" module connects Staff to Patients.

Full CRUD functionality was implemented to create, view, edit, and delete assignments.

Major Architectural Upgrades (Day 5)
Day 5 focused on building a robust and secure foundation for the entire application.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System:

The spatie/laravel-permission package was installed and configured.

Three system roles were created: Super Admin, Admin, and Staff.

Seeders were configured to automatically assign these roles to users during development.

Critical Fix: The bootstrap/app.php file was updated to manually register the role middleware alias, fixing a Target class [role] does not exist error.

Route Naming and Protection:

All administrative routes were grouped under a /dashboard prefix and given a admin. name prefix (e.g., admin.patients.index).

All staff-specific routes were grouped and given a staff. name prefix.

Critical Fix: All frontend components (AppSidebar.vue, Index.vue, Create.vue, Edit.vue for all modules) were updated to use these new, correct route names, resolving numerous Ziggy error: route ... is not in the route list errors.

Staff Availability & Conflict Detection:

A new staff_availabilities table was created for staff to declare their availability.

A staff-facing calendar UI was built (/dashboard/my-availability) allowing staff to create, edit, and delete "Available" and "Unavailable" time slots.

An admin-facing list view was created to see all availability records.

Critical Fix: A major timezone bug causing a 3-hour "jump" was resolved by ensuring all frontend components convert local times to UTC ISO strings before sending them to the backend.

Key Feature: A custom validation rule (StaffIsAvailableForShift) was implemented. It successfully prevents an admin from creating an assignment that conflicts with either another assignment or a staff member's declared unavailability.

Final UI Fix: The staff calendar was updated to show a unified view of both their personal availability slots (editable) and their official work assignments (read-only).

Current Project Status
The application is in a stable, secure, and working state. The foundational RBAC system is complete, and the core scheduling logic (availability and conflict detection) is functional. The project is ready to proceed with the next feature module.

## Day 6: Visit & Service Management

With the foundational modules in place, the next logical step is to build the **Visit & Service Management** module. This module is critical for tracking the actual services provided to patients.

### Plan:

1.  **Database:** Create the `visit_services` table migration and model.
2.  **Backend:** Implement the `VisitServiceController` with full CRUD functionality.
3.  **Frontend:** Develop the Vue components for managing visit services (`Index`, `Create`, `Edit`, `Show`, `Form`).
4.  **Routes & Navigation:** Add the necessary routes and update the sidebar.
