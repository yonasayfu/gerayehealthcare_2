Hello,

I am continuing development on my Home-to-Home Care Platform. I would like you to assist me with building a new module today.

Before we begin, you must understand the complete project context. Please perform the following steps in order:

First, read the four standard planning documents I have provided: STANDARD_WORKFLOW.md, PROJECT_ROADMAP.md, DATABASE_SCHEMA.md, and MODULE_IMPLEMENTATION_TEMPLATE.md, routes.md, Appsidebar.md

Next, read the Project_Development_Summary_Day 1-5.md file I have provided. This document will give you a detailed history of our development progress, including the features and bug fixes we have already implemented.

After you have read and understood all five documents, please confirm this by responding with "I have reviewed the project plans and summary and am ready to proceed." Do not proceed until you have given this confirmation.

Once confirmed, we will begin building the "Visit Services" module.for your informations for each major change even
