Hello,

I am continuing development on my Home-to-Home Care Platform. My goal is to proceed with the unfinished modules, starting with the ..@ module as outlined in the `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md`.

To ensure you have the most up-to-date context, I have just updated the following key project documentation files:

*   **`PROJECT_ROADMAP.md`**: This file now accurately reflects the current status of all feature modules (Done, In Progress, To Do) and includes a detailed "Development Progress Summary" of Day 1-n accomplishments and the plan for Day n (......).
*   **`DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`**: The database schema has been updated to include all recent table and column additions/modifications from completed migrations, ensuring it reflects the current database structure.
*   **`Routes.md`**: This file now includes the actual resource routes for the "Visit Services" module, replacing the previous placeholder.
*   **`AppSidebar.md`**: The navigation link for all moduel

*   **`Patient_FrontView.md`**: which hold/has all front end files ( index,Form,Create,Edit,Show,PrintAll), This template is the one you follow for consitency for our front end implemntation.if any moduel need to implment this featrue you shold follow this template design, in the template there are CR
*   **`STANDARD_WORKFLOW.md`**: A new step has been added to this document emphasizing the importance of updating relevant `.md` files after significant progress for clear communication among AI agents.

Please review and understand the updated content of these six documents: `STANDARD_WORKFLOW.md`, `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md`, `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`, `MODULE_IMPLEMENTATION_TEMPLATE.md`, `Routes.md`, and `AppSidebar.md`.

After you have thoroughly reviewed and understood all the updated documents, please confirm this by responding with: "I have reviewed the updated project documentation and am ready to proceed with the unfinished modules, starting with ....."

Do not proceed with any development tasks until you have given this confirmation. Remember, for each major change, even if a day's tasks are not fully completed, we will commit and push to git.
