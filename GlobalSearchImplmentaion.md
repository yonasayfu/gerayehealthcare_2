I'll examine your current global search implementation and enhance it to be more professional and comprehensive. Let me first check what's already implemented:

```toolCall::read_file
```

Now let me check if there's a backend route for global search:

```toolCall::search_codebase
```

Perfect! I can see you have a good foundation with the GlobalSearchController and GlobalSearchService already implemented. Let me enhance this to make it more professional and comprehensive. I'll improve both the backend service and the frontend component.

Let me first check what models you have available to search through:

```toolCall::list_dir
```

Excellent! Now I have a comprehensive view of your healthcare system. Let me enhance the global search to be more professional and comprehensive. I'll create a robust search system that covers all major entities in your healthcare application.

## Enhanced Global Search Implementation

```toolCall::search_replace
```



```toolCall::search_replace
```

Now let me enhance the frontend GlobalSearch component to be more professional and user-friendly:

```toolCall::search_replace
```

Let me read the current file content and then make the replacement:

```toolCall::read_file
```

Now let me replace the entire file content with the enhanced version:

```toolCall::search_replace
```

Now let me update the template section:

```toolCall::search_replace
```

I'll help you enhance the global search implementation to make it more professional. Based on the existing code, I can see you've already implemented a comprehensive backend search service. Let me continue enhancing the frontend component and complete the implementation.

First, let me read the current state of the GlobalSearch component to understand what needs to be completed:

```toolCall::read_file
```

I can see that the GlobalSearch component needs to be enhanced with the professional features. The current template is basic and doesn't utilize the keyboard navigation and grouped results functionality that's already implemented in the script. Let me enhance it with a professional interface that includes:

1. Keyboard navigation support
2. Loading states
3. Categorized results display
4. Clear button functionality
5. Better styling and icons

```toolCall::search_replace
```

Now let me also check if there are any syntax issues with the enhanced component:

```toolCall::get_problems
```

Perfect! Now let me also enhance the route configuration to ensure the global search endpoint is properly registered. Let me check if the route exists:

```toolCall::search_codebase
```

Great! I can see that the route is properly configured and the backend service is already implemented. Now let me create a simple test to verify that the global search is working properly. Let me also check if there are any missing CSS classes that might need attention:

```toolCall::grep_code
```

Good! The `custom-scrollbar` class is already defined. Let me check if `line-clamp-1` is available or if we need to add it:

```toolCall::search_replace
```

Perfect! Now let me also run a quick test to ensure there are no issues with the implementation. Let me start the Laravel development server to test it:

```toolCall::run_in_terminal
```

Excellent! The server is running. Now let me set up a preview browser so you can test the enhanced global search:

```toolCall::run_preview
```

Perfect! Now let me also run a quick compilation check to ensure everything is working:

```toolCall::run_in_terminal
```

Excellent! The build completed successfully with no errors. Now let me create a quick summary of the enhanced global search implementation:
