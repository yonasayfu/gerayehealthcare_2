‚úÖ This structure makes it easier for **AI agents or developers** to:

1. **Prioritize** (critical errors first: RBAC, missing classes, SQL issues).
2. **Assign** (UI vs Backend vs DB).
3. **Track** fixes across modules consistently.

üëâ Do you want me to now **turn this into a proper GitHub Issues template (markdown with checklists)** so your dev team/AI agents can directly import and manage each issue?
