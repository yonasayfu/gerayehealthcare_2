# Forgot Password Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

1. **Enhanced Login Page UI**:
   - Replaced the traditional page redirect with a popup dialog for the "Forgot Password" functionality
   - Added a modern dialog component using the existing UI framework
   - Implemented a clean, user-friendly interface similar to Gmail's password reset flow

2. **Dialog Features**:
   - Email input field with validation
   - Success message display after sending reset link
   - Cancel/Close buttons for better user experience
   - Loading state during submission

3. **Backend Integration**:
   - Connected the dialog to the existing Laravel password reset functionality
   - Maintained compatibility with the mailcatcher setup
   - Preserved all existing backend logic

## How It Works

1. **User Interaction**:
   - User visits the login page at http://127.0.0.1:8000/login
   - User clicks the "Forgot password?" link
   - A modal dialog opens with an email input field

2. **Password Reset Request**:
   - User enters their email address
   - User clicks "Send Reset Link"
   - System validates the email and sends a reset link via SMTP to port 1025

3. **Success Feedback**:
   - If successful, user sees "Password reset link sent!" message
   - User can close the dialog and check their email

4. **Email Verification**:
   - Emails are captured by the mailcatcher at http://127.0.0.1:8001
   - User can view the reset email and click the reset link
   - User is redirected to the password reset form
