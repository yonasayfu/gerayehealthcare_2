# Project Roadmap & Vision: Home-to-Home Care Platform

This document outlines the vision, architecture, features, and technology stack for the Home-to-Home Care Platform.

## 0. Execution Plan with Web-Chat AI Agents

To execute issues via browser-based AI agents with limited project access, use a consistent ‚Äúcontext pack‚Äù for every task:

- **Context Pack (always share):**
  - PROJECT_ROADMAP.md (this file)
  - DATABASE_SCHEMA.md
  - ISSUE_TRACKER.md (filtered to the target issue)
  - Only the directly related code for the issue: controller(s), model(s), service(s), Vue pages/components, routes, and any config used

- **Issue Brief Template (paste into chat):**
  - Title: <clear, single-scope change>
  - Module: <Patients | Staff | Inventory | ...>
  - Current behavior: <what happens now>
  - Expected behavior: <what you want>
  - Files provided: <list>
  - Routes/UI entry points: <route names + Vue paths>
  - Constraints: <tech constraints, coding standards>
  - Done criteria: <acceptance checks>

- **Sharing strategy:**
  - Start with the 3 docs + the minimal set of files needed.
  - If the agent asks for more, share only the requested file(s).
  - Keep issues small; avoid multi-module changes in a single chat.

## Sprint Plan (90-day outline)

- **Sprint 1 (Weeks 1‚Äì3): Phase 1, Modules 1‚Äì4**
  - Stabilize Staff, Patients, Caregiver Assignments, Visit Services.
  - Target: close all ‚Äúblocking‚Äù and ‚Äúdata integrity‚Äù issues first.

- **Sprint 2 (Weeks 4‚Äì6): Phase 2, Modules 5‚Äì12**
  - Admin & Inventory reliability. Seeders for reproducible testing.

- **Sprint 3 (Weeks 7‚Äì9): Phase 2 cont. + Phase 3 (start)**
  - Transactions/Alerts polish; begin Marketing Campaigns/Leads.

- **Sprint 4 (Weeks 10‚Äì12): Phase 3 wrap-up**
  - Complete Marketing modules and Events.

- **Sprint 5 (Weeks 13‚Äì15): Phase 4**
