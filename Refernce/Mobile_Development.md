# Mobile Development Guide: Geraye Health Care

This document provides a guide for developing the mobile application for the Geraye Health Care project.

## Mobile App Vision

The mobile application will provide a convenient and user-friendly way for patients and doctors to interact with the Geraye Health Care system. The app will be available on both iOS and Android devices.

## Technology Stack

The mobile application will be developed using **Flutter**, a cross-platform UI toolkit from Google. This will allow us to build a single codebase for both iOS and Android, saving time and resources.

## Development Roadmap

The mobile app development will be divided into the following phases:

1.  **Foundation Setup:** Set up the basic infrastructure for the mobile app, including project structure, navigation, and state management.
2.  **API Integration:** Integrate the mobile app with the Geraye Health Care API to fetch and display data.
3.  **Core Features:** Implement the core features of the mobile app, such as appointment scheduling, medical record management, and prescription management.
4.  **UI/UX Polish:** Polish the user interface and user experience of the mobile app to make it more intuitive and user-friendly.
5.  **Testing:** Write comprehensive tests for the mobile app to ensure its quality and reliability.

## Getting Started

To start working on the mobile app, you will need to:

1.  **Set up your development environment:** Install the Flutter SDK and other necessary tools.
2.  **Create a new Flutter project:** Create a new Flutter project for the Geraye Health Care mobile app.
3.  **Implement the UI:** Implement the UI for the mobile app using Flutter widgets.
4.  **Integrate with the API:** Integrate the mobile app with the Geraye Health Care API to fetch and display data.
5.  **Write tests:** Write tests for the mobile app to ensure its quality and reliability.

## Mobile App Best Practices

*   **Use a consistent coding style:** Use a consistent coding style to make the code more readable and maintainable.
*   **Use a state management solution:** Use a state management solution like Provider or BLoC to manage the state of the application.
*   **Use a dependency injection solution:** Use a dependency injection solution like get_it to manage the dependencies of the application.
*   **Write tests:** Write tests for the mobile app to ensure its quality and reliability.
