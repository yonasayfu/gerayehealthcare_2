# Git Workflow Summary

## Branch Created
- **Branch Name**: `git-workflow-improvements`
- **Purpose**: Improvements to Git workflow and documentation

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation Improvements

- Updated [GIT_COMMANDS_GUIDE.md](GIT_COMMANDS_GUIDE.md) to reference the new workflow documentation
- Added [COMMANDS_USED.md](COMMANDS_USED.md) to document all commands used during development
- Created [FORGOT_PASSWORD_ENHANCEMENTS_SUMMARY.md](FORGOT_PASSWORD_ENHANCEMENTS_SUMMARY.md) to document the forgot password improvements
- Created [FORGOT_PASSWORD_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](FORGOT_PASSWORD_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md) to document the initial implementation

  - The mailcatcher directory (separate project)
  - Command output files

### 3. Code Additions
- Added `TestPasswordResetCommand.php` - A console command to test password reset functionality

### 4. Git Operations
- Created and switched to `git-workflow-improvements` branch
- Committed changes in logical, well-documented commits
- Pushed branch to remote repository
- Applied stashed changes to continue working

## Best Practices Demonstrated

### Commit Messages
All commits follow the Conventional Commits specification:
- `docs: add comprehensive Git workflow documentation and related guides`
- `fix: exclude mailcatcher directory from main repository`
- `feat: add test command for password reset functionality`

### Branch Management
- Created feature branch from existing branch
- Made focused changes related to a single purpose
- Committed frequently with descriptive messages
- Pushed branch to remote for collaboration

### File Organization
- Properly categorized files (documentation, configuration, code)
- Updated .gitignore to maintain clean repository
- Separated concerns (mailcatcher as separate project)

## Next Steps

1. **Create Pull Request**: Submit a pull request to merge `git-workflow-improvements` into `develop`
2. **Code Review**: Request review from team members
3. **Merge**: After approval, merge the branch using "Squash and merge" for clean history
4. **Delete Branch**: Remove the feature branch after merging
5. **Continue Work**: Switch back to your original branch and continue development

## Commands to Continue Working

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch

# Switch to your original working branch
git checkout feature/working-withStarterKit

# Apply stashed changes if needed
git stash apply

# Continue working on your changes
# ...

# When ready to commit, create a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-new-feature

# Add and commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: describe your changes"

# Push to remote
git push origin feature/your-new-feature
```

## Useful Git Aliases

Consider adding these aliases to your `.gitconfig` for faster workflow:

```bash
# Add to ~/.gitconfig
[alias]
    st = status
    co = checkout
    br = branch
    ci = commit
    ps = push
    pl = pull
    lg = log --graph --oneline --all
    amend = commit --amend --no-edit
    undo = reset HEAD~1
```
