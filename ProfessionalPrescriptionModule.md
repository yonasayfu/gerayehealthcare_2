   - Consistent design language with other application modules
   - Professional medical-oriented color scheme

2. **Advanced Sharing Capabilities**
   - Email sharing with customizable messages
   - Social media integration (WhatsApp, Twitter, Telegram)
   - Secure token-based sharing with expiration
   - PIN protection for sensitive prescriptions

3. **Professional UI/UX Design**
   - Improved component organization and layout
   - Enhanced typography and spacing
   - Consistent iconography and visual hierarchy

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture

#### Controller Enhancements
The `PrescriptionController` was extended with a new `shareViaEmail` method that:
- Validates email addresses and custom messages
- Automatically generates share links when needed
- Uses Laravel's Mail facade for reliable email delivery
- Provides comprehensive error handling and user feedback

#### Route Configuration
A new POST route was added:
```
Route::post('prescriptions/{prescription}/share-email', [PrescriptionController::class, 'shareViaEmail'])->name('prescriptions.shareEmail');
```

#### Security Features
- CSRF protection for all sharing operations
- Token-based authentication for public access
- Expiration dates for shared links (30 days by default)
- Optional PIN protection for sensitive prescriptions

### Frontend Implementation

#### Component Structure
The Vue components were enhanced with:
- Improved type safety and error handling
- Better component imports and organization
- Enhanced user feedback mechanisms

#### Sharing Interface
The sharing dropdown was expanded to include:
- Email sharing option with modal dialog
- Input validation for email addresses
- Custom message composition
- Real-time feedback for sending status

#### Status Visualization
The prescription list now displays:
- Color-coded badges for each status type
- Consistent styling with the application's design system
- Improved readability and scanning capabilities
