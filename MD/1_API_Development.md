# API Development Guide: Geraye Health Care

This document provides a guide for developing the API for the Geraye Health Care project.

## API Vision

The API will serve as the backbone for the mobile application and any future third-party integrations. It will be designed to be:

*   **Robust:** The API will be well-tested and reliable.
*   **Well-documented:** The API will be fully documented using a tool like Swagger or OpenAPI.
*   **Secure:** The API will use modern authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive data.
*   **Performant:** The API will be optimized for speed and scalability.

## Development Plan

The API development will be divided into the following phases:

1.  **Foundation Setup:** Set up the basic infrastructure for the API, including routing, authentication, and error handling.
2.  **Core Endpoints:** Implement the core API endpoints for managing patients, staff, appointments, and other key resources.
3.  **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement a secure authentication and authorization system using Laravel Sanctum.
4.  **Documentation:** Document the API using Swagger or OpenAPI.
5.  **Testing:** Write comprehensive tests for the API to ensure its quality and reliability.

## Getting Started

To start working on the API, you will need to:

1.  **Create a new branch:** Create a new Git branch for your API development work.
2.  **Define the API routes:** Define the API routes in the `routes/api.php` file.
3.  **Create the API controllers:** Create the API controllers in the `app/Http/Controllers/Api` directory.
4.  **Implement the API logic:** Implement the API logic in the controllers and services.
5.  **Write tests:** Write tests for the API in the `tests/Feature` directory.

## API Best Practices

*   **Use a consistent naming convention:** Use a consistent naming convention for routes, controllers, and other API resources.
*   **Use a consistent response format:** Use a consistent response format for all API responses.
*   **Use a consistent error handling mechanism:** Use a consistent error handling mechanism for all API errors.
*   **Use a consistent authentication and authorization mechanism:** Use a consistent authentication and authorization mechanism for all API endpoints.
*   **Document the API:** Document the API using a tool like Swagger or OpenAPI.
