# Dashboard Improvements

## Global Search Enhancement

### Issue
The global search functionality in `/resources/js/components/GlobalSearch.vue` was only working for patients and staff members. Other modules like invoices, marketing campaigns, inventory items, etc. were not searchable.

### Solution
Enhanced the global search to support all major modules in the application:

1. Updated `app/Services/GlobalSearchService.php` to include search functionality for:
   - Patients
   - Staff
   - Visit Services
   - Invoices
   - Shared Invoices
   - Marketing Campaigns
   - Marketing Leads
   - Inventory Items
   - Suppliers
   - Insurance Policies
   - Insurance Claims
   - Events
   - ServicesUnresolvable dependency resolving [Parameter #0 [ <required> $model ]] in class App\Services\Base\BaseService

   - Referrals
   - Partners

2. Modified the frontend component `/resources/js/components/GlobalSearch.vue` to:
   - Remove the "Coming Soon" message
   - Properly display results for all modules
   - Organize results by category (Healthcare, Financial, Inventory, Services, Events, Marketing)
   - Show appropriate icons for each entity type
   - Provide better user feedback when no results are found

### Implementation Details
- The search service now queries across 15 different entity types
- Results are sorted by relevance score
- Each entity type has appropriate fields for searching:
  - **Patients**: full_name, patient_code, phone_number, email
  - **Staff**: first_name, last_name, email, position, role
  - **Visit Services**: service_type, status, scheduled_date_time
  - **Invoices**: invoice_number, status, total_amount, due_date
  - **Shared Invoices**: invoice_number, status, total_amount
  - **Marketing Campaigns**: name, status, start_date, end_date
  - **Marketing Leads**: name, email, phone, status
  - **Inventory Items**: name, sku, quantity, category
  - **Suppliers**: name, contact_person, email, phone
  - **Insurance Policies**: policy_number, insurance_company, policy_holder_name, status
  - **Insurance Claims**: claim_number, status, total_amount
  - **Events**: title, description, start_time, end_time
  - **Services**: name, description, category
  - **Referrals**: referral_code, status, source, destination
  - **Partners**: name, contact_person, email, phone
- The frontend displays results in categorized groups
- Icons and category badges help users quickly identify result types
- Added error handling to gracefully handle database issues
- Added database compatibility for PostgreSQL (ILIKE) and SQLite/MySQL (LIKE)

### Testing
To test the enhanced global search:
1. Open the global search modal using Cmd+K (Mac) or Ctrl+K (Windows/Linux)
2. Search for terms related to any entity type:
   - Patient names or codes
   - Staff names or positions
   - Invoice numbers
   - Marketing campaign names
   - Inventory item names or SKUs
   - Event titles
   - Service names
   - etc.
3. Verify that results from all modules appear in the search results
4. Click on any result to navigate to the appropriate detail page

### Benefits
- Users can now search across the entire application from one place
- Improved productivity by reducing time spent navigating between modules
- Better organization of search results by category
- Enhanced user experience with visual indicators for different entity types
- Robust error handling ensures the application remains stable even if some modules have issues

### Future Improvements
- Add search filters to allow users to narrow down results by module
- Implement search suggestions as users type
- Add advanced search options with field-specific filters
- Improve relevance scoring algorithm based on user behavior
- Add search analytics to track popular search terms
