Issue Summary — Phases 0–10 and Outstanding Items

Overview
- This document maps the original issues to what’s been delivered across Phases 0–10, highlights what remains, and lists next actions for a smooth wrap‑up.

What’s Done
- Routing (Phase 4)
  - Grouped by domain under `dashboard` with `admin.*` names; merged marketing routes into web.php; deduplicated blocks; guarded dev‑only routes.
  - Fixed Ziggy usage in SPA to use `@routes` so all named routes resolve.

- Exports/Print (Phase 6)
  - Centralized print + export via `ExportableTrait`; standardized configs in `ExportConfig`/`AdditionalExportConfigs`.
  - Removed per‑module Print*.vue; consolidated on Blade `pdf-layout.blade.php` with `print.css`.

- Controllers/Services (Phase 3 highlights)
  - Thin controllers enforced across modules; heavy logic sits in Services; normalized API returns to Resources.

- Notifications/Logs (Phase 7)
  - TaskDelegationAssigned now via database + mail for parity.
  - Added Admin Audit UI: `admin.reports.audit` displays tail of laravel.log with filters.

- Storage & Assets (Phase 8)
  - Local fonts via `@font-face`; removed external font CDN; documented storage strategy in `STORAGE.md` and added `.gitkeep`.

- Frontend Consistency (Phase 5)
  - Implemented `useTableFilters` in key lists: Patients, Inventory Items, Events, Visit Services, Users, Staff, Services, Partners, Referrals, Referral Documents, Prescriptions, Shared Invoices, Suppliers.
  - Event Participants: new Form.vue with labeled fields + populated selects; Create/Edit wired to pass props.
  - Unified “glass” auth layout merging split + card (`AuthGlassLayout.vue`), used by Login/Register.

- Seeding & Factories
  - Expanded DatabaseSeeder to populate all major modules (staff, patients, caregivers, clinical, inventory, partners/referrals, events, finance, marketing, messaging samples).
  - New: EventParticipantFactory, EventModuleSeeder, EligibilityCriteriaSeeder, PrescriptionSeeder, InventoryMaintenanceRecordSeeder, InventoryTransactionsSeeder.
  - Command: `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`.

Partially Resolved / In Progress
- Documentation consistency for `AdditionalExportConfigs`: partially used (e.g., Prescriptions). A short README for adding new module configs can help.
- Report controllers (ServiceVolume, RevenueAR, MarketingRoi) still use bespoke export paths; can be migrated to `ExportableTrait` for full uniformity.
- Some Create/Edit pages may need final polish to match Patient/Staff form quality. Event‑related Create forms (recommendations, staff assignments, broadcasts, eligibility) already have labels/selects; verify backend provides props for all.

Open Items (from OriginalIssue.md)
- Auth & Password Reset (prod readiness):
  - Wire production mailer in `.env` and `config/mail.php`; keep local fake mail for dev.
  - Add a brief § in docs for mail config + testing.

- Welcome page and exposure:
  - Current Welcome.vue uses a default template. If you want a product‑style welcome (or guard), define the desired look or redirect unauth users to login.

- MyVisits (geo + mobile parity):
  - Backend endpoints exist; ensure geo validation and app‑side behavior are tested on devices. Add test scenario docs for staff check‑in/out + location.

- Types consolidation (`resources/js/types.ts` vs `resources/js/types/*`):
  - Both exist; align to a single folder (`resources/js/types`) and re‑export in `index.d.ts`.

Recommended Next Steps
1) Mail + Password Reset
   - Configure production mailer; add a `MAIL.md` quickstart; smoke‑test Forgot Password flow.

2) Reports → `ExportableTrait`
   - Migrate ServiceVolume/RevenueAR/MarketingRoi export to `ExportableTrait`; add configs.

3) Frontend Form Consistency
   - Sweep remaining Admin Create/Edit pages to use shared Form components; ensure labels, help text, and populated selects (events/patients/staff) are passed from controllers.

4) Types consolidation
   - Flatten types under `resources/js/types` and export from a single barrel file.

5) QA + Seed
   - Run `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed` and QA primary flows (patients, visits, inventory, marketing, partners/referrals, invoices, prescriptions, messages).

How to Test
- Routes: `php artisan route:list | rg -n 'marketing|patients|events'`
- Seed: `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`
- Export/Print: Use list pages’ buttons; PDFs stream using `pdf-layout.blade.php`.
- Audit UI: `/dashboard/reports/audit` (search + level)
- Auth: Login/Register show glass layout; Forgot Password reaches mailer.

Key Files
- Routing: `routes/web.php`, `resources/js/app.ts`
- Exports/Print: `app/Http/Traits/ExportableTrait.php`, `app/Http/Config/ExportConfig.php`, `resources/views/pdf-layout.blade.php`
- Storage: `STORAGE.md`, `resources/css/app.css` (font faces)
- Frontend patterns: `resources/js/composables/useTableFilters.ts`, `resources/js/composables/useExport.ts`
- Auth layout: `resources/js/layouts/auth/AuthGlassLayout.vue`, `resources/js/layouts/AuthLayout.vue`
