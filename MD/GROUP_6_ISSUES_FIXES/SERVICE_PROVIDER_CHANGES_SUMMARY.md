## 2. Analysis

### 2.1 Event System
All registered events and listeners in EventServiceProvider are functional:
- CaregiverAssigned → SendCaregiverAssignmentNotification
- InventoryRequestSaved → CheckForLowStock
- PatientCreatedFromRecommendation → CreatePatientFromRecommendation
- EventParticipantRegistered → RegisterEventParticipant
- StaffAssignedToEvent → AssignStaffToEvent

Four message-related events exist but don't have listeners yet:
- NewMessage
- MessageReacted
- MessageDeleted
- MessageUpdated

These placeholders have been added to prepare for future implementation.

### 2.2 Authorization System
The AuthServiceProvider now covers 26 models with policies, including critical business entities:
- Financial data (Invoice, InsuranceClaim, InsurancePolicy)
- Patient data (Patient, MedicalDocument)
- Staff data (Staff)
- Business relationships (Partner)
- Marketing assets (MarketingBudget, MarketingCampaign, MarketingTask)
- Inventory management (InventoryItem, InventoryRequest, etc.)
- Communication (Message)
- Operations (Event, Service)
- User management (User, Role)
- Task delegation (TaskDelegation)
