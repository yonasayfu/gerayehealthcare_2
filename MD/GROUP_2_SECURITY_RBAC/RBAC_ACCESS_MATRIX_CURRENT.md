# RBAC Access Matrix (Current)

Applies to default configuration. Fine-grained access is controlled via Spatie permissions and Laravel policies; roles can have multiple assignments (e.g., CEO + Staff). Super Admin bypasses all checks (Gate::before).

## Roles

- Super Admin: Full access across all modules.
- CEO: Executive view across modules; can access analytics/reports; operational access is permission-driven.
- COO: Operational lead; access to staff/visits/patients/inventory; analytics/reports; permission-driven.
- Admin: Administrative management across most modules; permission-driven.
- Staff: Self-service (my-*) and limited clinical/operational actions per assigned permissions; staff-only routes under `dashboard/staff.*` also available.
- Guest: No authenticated access.

- Messaging (web + API): `view messages` (reads), `export messages` (export)

## Default Visibility (Sidebar)

- Links render only if the user has the exact permission used by the backend route.
- Staff-only tools (My Tasks, My Visits, My Availability, My Earnings, My Leave Requests) require the Staff role and render independently of admin modules.
- System Management (Roles/Users) renders only for Super Admin by default: `manage roles`, `manage users`.

## API Protection

- API (`/api/v1`) guarded by Sanctum. Endpoints further protected with permission middleware mirroring the above keys (e.g., `permission:view prescriptions`). Rate limits applied on write operations.

## Multi-Role Behavior

- When a user has multiple roles (e.g., CEO + Staff), the sidebar merges Admin and Staff groups, deduplicating overlapping links.
- Super Admin always sees all modules; Staff tools are additionally shown if the Super Admin also has the Staff role.

## Next Steps / Validation

- Verify role/permission assignment UI updates reflect in Inertia `auth.user.permissions` promptly (navigate or reload to refresh sidebar).
- Optionally add server-side `can:` middleware to marketing routes for stricter enforcement.
