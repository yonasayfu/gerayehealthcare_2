- Check with: `git branch`

### Remote Names:
Most repos use `origin`, but verify:
```bash
git remote -v
```

### Protected Branches:
If your main/master branch is protected:
1. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/ui-consistency-fixes
   git push origin feature/ui-consistency-fixes
   ```
2. Create a Pull Request on GitHub/GitLab
3. Request review and merge

### Large Commit Size:
If the commit is too large and push fails:
```bash
# Increase buffer size
git config http.postBuffer 524288000

# Or push with larger packet size
git push --no-thin origin main
```

---
