# UI Consistency Fixes - FINAL ACCURATE LIST

**Status**: Ready to Execute  
**Approach**: Pragmatic - Fix what makes sense, document special cases  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION

After detailed audit, some files are **special cases** that don't fit standard CRUD patterns:

### Special Case Files (Won't Fix - Document Why)
1. **Messages/Index.vue** - Full messaging/chat interface, not a CRUD list
2. **Dashboard/Index.vue** - Analytics dashboard, not a CRUD list  
3. **Reports/Index.vue** - Report builder interface
4. **Reports/Audit/Index.vue** - Audit log viewer

**Decision**: These don't need standard CRUD buttons (Print/Export) because they have their own specialized UI patterns.
