# Task Delegation Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes made to address the issues in the task delegation functionality.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Category Dropdown Options
**Problem**: The category dropdown in edit.vue only had 3 options.
**Solution**: Added more category options to the dropdown in Form.vue:
- Administrative
- Clinical
- Financial
- General
- HR
- IT
- Marketing
- Operations
- Patient Care
- Quality Assurance
- Engagement
- Other

### 2. Empty Partner Dropdown
**Problem**: The Partner (for Engagement) dropdown was empty.
**Solution**: 
- Modified AdminTaskDelegationController.php to pass partners data to both create and edit views
- Updated Edit.vue to pass partners data to the Form component
- Partners are now fetched and available in the engagement dropdown

### 3. Print UI Consistency
**Problem**: The print UI in show.vue was not consistent with index.vue.
**Solution**:
- Updated Show.vue to improve the print UI consistency
- Added better styling and layout matching the index view
- Improved the display of task details with proper grid layout
- Added category and priority level displays

### 4. Delete Functionality Consistency
**Problem**: The delete functionality in show.vue used an alert window while index.vue used a popup.
**Solution**:
- Replaced the browser confirm dialog with a custom modal popup in Show.vue
- Added a delete confirmation modal with proper styling
- Maintained consistent design with the rest of the application
