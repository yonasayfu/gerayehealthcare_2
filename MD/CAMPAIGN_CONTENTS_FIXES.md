# Campaign Contents Validation Fixes

## Issue
When creating new Campaign Contents, users were encountering a "Validation failed. Please check your input." error. This was preventing successful creation of campaign content items.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Datetime Field Handling**: The datetime fields (scheduled_post_date and actual_post_date) were not being properly formatted, causing validation failures.

2. **JSON Validation for Engagement Metrics**: The engagement_metrics field expects valid JSON, but the form was not properly handling validation of this field.

3. **Inconsistent Data Handling**: There was inconsistent handling of the engagement_metrics field between Create and Edit forms.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. DateTime Field Improvements (Form.vue)
- Added proper error handling for date parsing
- Ensured empty values are handled correctly
- Improved the computed properties for date formatting

### 2. JSON Validation for Engagement Metrics (Form.vue)
- Added client-side JSON validation
- Added placeholder text to guide users on proper JSON format
- Implemented input handler to validate JSON in real-time

### 3. Consistent Form Handling
- Ensured both Create and Edit forms handle data consistently
- Maintained proper data binding for all form fields

## Technical Details

### DateTime Handling
The computed properties for date formatting were improved to:
- Check if the date value exists before processing
- Validate that the date is a valid Date object
- Return empty string for invalid dates instead of causing errors

### JSON Validation
The engagement_metrics field now:
- Uses a custom input handler instead of direct v-model binding
- Attempts to parse JSON on input to provide immediate feedback
- Shows placeholder text with example JSON format

## Testing
To test these fixes:
1. Navigate to Campaign Contents > Create
2. Fill in the form with valid data
3. Ensure datetime fields work correctly
4. Enter valid JSON in the engagement_metrics field
5. Submit the form

The validation error should no longer occur with properly formatted data.
